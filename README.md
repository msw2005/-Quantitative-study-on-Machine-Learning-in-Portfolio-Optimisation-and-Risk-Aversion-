Project Overview
This repository contains code and experiments related to machine learning–based portfolio optimisation and risk management. The goal is to explore how different models and optimisation techniques can be applied to construct portfolios under various risk and return constraints.
Features
• Data loading and preprocessing utilities
• Exploratory data analysis (EDA) scripts
• Portfolio optimisation algorithms
• Risk metrics and evaluation tools
• Experiment configuration and results logging
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
• Python 3.9+
• `pip` or `conda` for dependency management
• Git (for cloning the repository)
